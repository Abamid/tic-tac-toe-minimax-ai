## 🧠 Project Overview

**Tic-Tac-Toe Minimax AI** is an intelligent game-playing web app built with **Python** and **Streamlit**, implementing the **Minimax algorithm**. This AI always plays optimally — you can’t beat it if it plays first!

This project demonstrates key concepts in **artificial intelligence**, **game theory**, and **adversarial search**.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The board is initialized with all empty cells.  
2. Players alternate turns — you vs the AI.  
3. The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** to evaluate all possible future game states.  
4. The app detects win/tie conditions and displays the result.  
5. Option to restart the game at any point.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

- Implemented a classic AI strategy (Minimax) from scratch  
- Built an interactive Streamlit web interface  
- Learned about game trees, recursion, and terminal states  
- Practiced clean project structuring and deployment
